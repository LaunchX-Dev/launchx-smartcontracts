The delegation staking smart contract.
The principle of the Synthetic Delegation Contract is quite simple.
User is able to stake the LNCHX tokens in the smart contract in exchange for the LNCHXP tokens.
The user will then be rewarded yields in bi-weekly cycles in LNCHX tokens,
deposited in the smart contract by a centralised authority.

The smart contract shall have a constructor that specifies the addresses of both lnchx and lnchxp token smart contracts.
The smart contract shall be upgradable through Proxy,
so the owner of the smart contract has an option to upgrade it in order to fix possible issues.

The contract will own the totalSupply of the LNCHXP tokens, they will be exchanged for LNCHX at 1:1 ratio at staking,
and received back by the contract on unstaking. So prior to making any staking transaction a transfer
the of totalSupply of the LNCHXP tokens to the synthetic contract shall be made.

In order to stake into smart contract the user will first call the “approve” method of the LNCHX token smart contract,
and then this method of the Synthetic Delegation Contract:

function stake(amount)

The previous “approve” call transaction should have been confirmed by now and should have been called for
the same amount of tokens.

As stake is called and LNCHX is transferred from the caller’s address the same amount of LNCHXP tokens
are transferred to the caller’s address from the synthetic delegation contract.

As the stake is performed the smart contract remembers the total amount staked by user and
the starting cycle (next biweekly cycle) the yield should be rewarded from.
No new stakes can be added by the same address until all yields from previous periods are claimed by the staker.

The stakes receives no yields from current 2 week cycle. Even if he posts the stake in the first day of the cycle.
The yields will start next cycle for him.

Anybody may deposit the bi-weekly Rewards and assign a cycle this reward should be applied to.
The reward may be assigned to current bi-weekly cycle too.

The following method shall be called when the rewards are deposited into the contract:
function shareReward(amount, cycle).
The “amount” is specified in LNCHX tokens, and the “cycle” shall be the cycle’s
index number that identifies the cycle this reward should be assigned to.
Prior to depositing the LNCHX tokens the operator who makes the reward deposit shall call the approve method of the
LNCHX token contract, allowing the smart contract to withdraw the same amount of from the operator’s wallet.
There should be ability to call this method more than once for the same cycle, so the rewards are added up.

The user may claim pending rewards for past cycles where she participated.
todo: ??? In order to save gas costs, the contract is designed to avoid large for loops.
One solution that was accepted by the team was that a new staking deposit can not be made
until all claimable rewards for the previous cycles have all been claimed.

The claiming of the rewards are done by calling this smart contract method:
function claim().

If there are rewards claimable by the user rewards for all previous cycles will be claimed in one call.
They will be transferred to the user in the same transaction.
The rewards for current cycle can not be claimed,
the user will need to wait for the end of the current cycle to be able to claim the reward.

todo: ??? when to allow reward for period index

The rewards claimable for an address can be retrieved via:
todo: claimableAmountOfUser(address)
The contract is also to have other view methods:
todo: totalTokensStaked()
Also a method to get current cycle index:
todo: getCurrentCycle()
And a method that returns rewards for a cycle.
todo: cycleTotalRewards(cycle)
todo: cycleRewardsOfUser(cycle, address)
On to the unstaking.
The unsticking is done in 2 transactions method calls:
todo: requestUnstake(amount)
This method will require the same amount of LNCHXP previously unlocked (approved)
for the contract to transfer from the caller’s address.
Once called, the LNCHXP tokens are transferred back to the Synthetic contract,
and the same amount of LNCHX tokens is reserved for withdrawal at the end of the current staking period.

Once the request is submitted, the user will not be awarded any yields beyond the current period.
She will need to complete the unstake, and then stake again to be able to get new rewards.
At any time after the cycle end the user can complete the Unstaking Request.
This step should be done by one method call without parameters:

unstake()
This method shall fail if there are any pending reward claims by address. (claimableAmountOfUser(address) > 0)
The frontend must know of any pending withdrawals by calling this method:
pendingUnstakeRequests(address)
